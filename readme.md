# HDA Sketches

Collection of [Houdini digital assets](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/assets/intro.html) (HDA).
HDAs should be compatible with game engines such like Unity and UnrealEngine. However they can't work without paid versions of Houdini (Indie) because files are shared as `.hdalc` extension.
